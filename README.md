# Utilizing Open Source Language Models and ChatGPT for Zero-Shot Identification of Drug Discontinuation Events (DDEs) in Online Forums

This project provides tools for classifying Drug Discontinuation Events (DDEs) using various models, including HuggingFace transformer models and GPT models. 

## Prerequisites
This project requires datasets that are forthcoming from [Dryad](https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.h44j0zps2). Please contact the authors for access.

The project has been tested with Python 3.9.


## Setting Up

Installation of the necessary dependencies can be achieved with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Repo Structure

The `DDE_detection` directory contains scripts and instructions for classifying DDEs using HuggingFace transformer models and GPT models. The `DDE_root_cause_classification` directory contains scripts and instructions for classifying the root cause(s) of DDEs using HuggingFace transformer models and GPT models.
